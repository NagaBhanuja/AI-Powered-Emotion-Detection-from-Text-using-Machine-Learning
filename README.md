🎭 AI-Powered Emotion Detection from Text📖 OverviewEmotion is one of the basic instincts of human beings. This project aims to detect and recognize feelings from textual data using Machine Learning. By analyzing the expressions in sentences, the model classifies text into specific emotional states such as anger, surprise, joy, fear, sadness, and love.This solution utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and Logistic Regression for classification.📂 DatasetThe project uses a dataset containing 20,000 entries of text and their corresponding sentiment labels.Input: Textual content (e.g., tweets, comments).Target: Sentiment class (6 categories).Classes: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: PythonEnvironment: Jupyter Notebook / Google ColabLibraries:Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)Seaborn & Matplotlib (Visualization)NLTK (Text Preprocessing: Stopwords, Lemmatization)Scikit-learn (Model Building & Evaluation)⚙️ MethodologyThe project follows a structured data science pipeline:Data Collection & Cleaning: Loading the dataset and handling missing values.Text Preprocessing:🧹 Punctuation Removal: Stripping special characters and numbers.😀 Emoji Handling: Replacing emojis with their text descriptions.✂️ Tokenization: Splitting sentences into words.🚫 Stopword Removal: Filtering out common English words.🌱 Lemmatization: Converting words to their base root form.Feature Extraction: Converting text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).Model Training: Training a Logistic Regression classifier on the processed data.📊 ResultsThe model achieves high performance in distinguishing between different emotions.MetricScoreAccuracy86.27%Precision88.31%Recall76.18%F1-Score80.54%Note: Detailed classification reports and confusion matrices are available in the notebook.🚀 How to RunClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection.git
